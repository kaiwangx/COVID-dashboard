# COVID-dashboard

This project was designed over the course of a semester by our team ( COVID Squad ). The intentions of this project were to gain experience with the Agile framework and implement user stories to create a personalized product. Together with the help of our professors and with the Mentorship of Dustin, Zach, and Patrick at Epic we created a project that we are all proud of.
